                <h2>Goals and Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on previous experience with the attention span of children/students, we brainstormed ideas on how to keep them engaged during an educational setting.
                    We observed that children/students get bored reading plain educational text even with pictures.
                    We hypothesized that children/students need a more interactive experience to help keep them interested in what they were learning about.

                    <strong>Insights</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Young people are used to dynamic content from screens, so the static images in books no longer pulls them in like it used to</li>
                        <li>Some learners are more visual and maximizing their ability to visualize the subject will increase their learning rate too</li>

            <h2>Prototyping Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Create an MR experience for children that can help them stay immersed in an educational book. 
                What is read in the book should be visualized in a 3D space so that children can see and learn from the virtual object 
                The content of the book may be uninteresting to the child, but being able to see the object being described could help keep the child stay interested.

            <h2>Reflection/Contribution</h2>
            <p>This project was new, challenging and interesting. The most difficult part was working with Unity because I have never played around with
            the game engine before.</p>
            <p> For my personal contributions, I aimed to get started as early as my final midterm was over. After my group met and
            discussed what our plans were, I went straight into working with Unity by first learning the basics and then laying out a starting framework
            that my groupmates could add onto. I was able to get the 'welcome' screen and help menu to display and toggle with buttons as well as contribute to displaying our desired animal rendering. Furthermore, I created a sharable power point with necessary
            information and a layout guide for other contributions.</p>
