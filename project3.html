                <p>
                    Based on previous experience with typhoon in Hong Kong, we brainstormed ideas on how to safely navigate people in need.
                    We observed that, with people in distress before typhoon, they have no idea of where to find shelter
                    We hypothesized that people in distress need help in finding shelter before a typhoon hits in order to reduce collateral damage

            <h2>Reflection/Contribution</h2>
            <p>This project was interesting in the way that coding was not the issue as much as hardware was. It was interesting to take some preloaded actions for the robot and see what could be made from combining them in a certain way.</p>
            <p> For my personal contributions, I mainly worked on the presentation/non-implementation portion of the project. My group was smart to divide the work so that some of us would concentrate on the robot's functionality while I and a couple others would work on the powerpoint, video demo, gathering outside sources to review/speed date our ideas and to overall solidify our entire presentation.</p>
